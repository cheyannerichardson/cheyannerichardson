About Me
Hi there! I’m a GIS professional with a background in cultural resource management and occupational therapy, now focusing on spatial data analysis and geospatial technologies. I’m interested in how everyday spaces—both modern and historical—reveal layers of culture, memory, and design, and how geospatial tools can help preserve their stories within a changing urban landscape.
I’m currently expanding my technical toolkit through self‑guided learning in:
    SQL – building database querying and management skills
    Excel – strengthening data cleaning and analytical workflows
    QGIS – developing map design, spatial analysis, and data visualization proficiency
Professional Foundation
With a foundation in both healthcare and cultural heritage work, I bring precision, analytical rigor, and accountability to complex data environments:
Occupational Therapy: Managed clinical documentation under Medicare guidelines, optimized workflows, and ensured compliance with highly regulated data standards.
Cultural Resource Management: Supported archaeological data workflows at the Gault School of Archaeology and the Texas Historical Commission, including artifact handling, cataloging, and digital data entry.
These experiences have strengthened my ability to:
    Organize and validate structured datasets
    Uphold data integrity and consistency
    Communicate technical findings to diverse stakeholders
    Navigate both modern and legacy information systems
What I’m Working On
    Developing GIS projects that blend open historical data with modern mapping tools to explore how places evolve over time.
    Building SQL workflows for data cleaning and geospatial database management that support clear, reliable analysis.
    Exploring accessibility and spatial design, using human‑centered mapping approaches to highlight how people move through and experience their environments.
I’m building a career that combines the analytical precision and data‑driven organization from my professional background with a growing focus on urbanism, architectural heritage, and spatial storytelling. I’m fascinated by how modern and historical spaces coexist and what they reveal about community and identity.
In the long term, I hope to study hanok architecture at Jeonbuk National University and explore ways to blend traditional design principles with sustainable, people‑centered urban planning.
Let’s connect on projects involving GIS, data visualization, architectural preservation, digital heritage mapping, or human‑centered design.
